"""
Public exceptions raised by decoy_engine.

The engine raises these typed exceptions where the caller benefits from
catching a specific failure mode (config errors, connector auth issues,
license problems). Internal code that has not been migrated to typed
exceptions yet may still raise generic ValueError / RuntimeError; that
is fine and will be tightened incrementally.

Anything not listed here is private and may change without a version bump.
