# What Decoy does not prove

Decoy is a practical de-identification and synthetic-data tool. It applies
recognized transformation primitives (masking, hashing, format-preserving
encryption, generalization, suppression, synthesis) and preserves structural
properties like foreign keys and determinism. This page is the honest boundary:
the things Decoy does NOT prove, so you do not rely on a guarantee it does not
make.

## It does not provide a formal privacy guarantee

Decoy does not implement, measure, or certify differential privacy or any other
formal privacy model. It does not attach an epsilon, a privacy budget, or a
mathematical bound on re-identification risk to its output. The `storm` profiler
reports heuristic re-identification-risk signals to help you assess a dataset;
those are diagnostics, not a proof. If your use case requires a formal privacy
guarantee, Decoy alone does not supply it.

## It does not certify legal or regulatory compliance

Decoy ships configuration bundles named after regulations (for example a HIPAA
Safe Harbor bundle that targets the 18 identifier categories). These are
engineering aids that encode a common interpretation of an identifier set. They
are not a compliance certification, not legal advice, and not a determination
that any given output meets a regulation as applied to your data. Whether a
masked dataset satisfies HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, or any other regime is a
determination for you and your counsel, considering your data, your context, and
the residual-risk analysis the regulation requires. Running a bundle named
`hipaa` does not by itself make a dataset HIPAA-compliant.

## It does not guarantee semantic correctness of free-text

Free-text redaction (`text_redact`) finds and replaces PII spans using
pattern-and-hint detectors. Detection is best-effort: it can miss an identifier
the detectors do not recognize (a false negative) or replace a span that was not
actually sensitive (a false positive). Decoy does not understand the meaning of
free text and does not guarantee that every identifier in a notes column has
been found, nor that the surviving text is semantically coherent. Treat
free-text output as reduced-risk, not as proven-clean, and review it where the
stakes warrant.

## It does not validate that your configuration matches your intent

Decoy validates a config against its schema and runs what the config says. It
does not know which columns in your data are actually sensitive. If a config
leaves a sensitive column on `passthrough`, or masks the wrong column, the run
will succeed and the output will leak. Use `storm` to find candidate PII and the
post-mask checks to look for residual identifiers, but the mapping from your
data's sensitivities to a correct config is yours to get right.

## What it does do

To be clear about the other side: Decoy does give you deterministic,
reproducible masking; foreign-key and join preservation across tables; a catalog
of standard de-identification transforms; PII detection and risk profiling; and
synthetic-data generation. Those are real and tested. This page exists so the
strength of those features is not mistaken for guarantees Decoy does not make.
